**How does it relate to the theme "inner enemy"**
Well this meets that theme by being about the expectations of getting good grades and avoid bad marks, but as time goes on the more expectations that you have untill you can't keep up. The other character is supposed to be a reflection of yourself. But they are unable to attack as they are the red block and represent the mental version of you still important but defenseless. While the blue block represents your physical body which is able to defend itself by you pressing the spacebar.
